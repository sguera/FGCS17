# FGCS17
Repository containing all the code used for the article submitted at FGCS17 SI

There is a folder for each of the experiments presented in the paper. For each experiment, there are as many folders as the systems on which we ran it, plus a folder containing the easyconfigs created by us. All the other easyconfigs are hosted and available at the EasyBuild repository: https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop
For each folder representing a system, there is a folder containing the code implemented for a certain experiment, a folder named methodType, containing the methods as defined by us, according to the description given in the paper, plus a folder containing the output of the experiments: results.json stores the ouputs, gnuplot.gp the script generated by PROVA! to print a graph. While the results.json is created after the experiment is ran, the gnuplot file is regenerated each time we want to produce a certain graph.
